      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Ever since I've started to develop games on Roblox Studio last year, I noticed that I haven't been playing much games on Roblox anymore. I don't bother to look at the front page becuase it always shows the same games that don't appeal to me. (which is understandable becuase I'm not the target audience on Roblox) But, trying to to search for anything new on the platform using their search page is useless becuase of the amount of low-quality stuff that are placed on the top, accumulated from years of botted, copied or abandoned games or even just random places that aren't even games. What's the use of trying to scroll when all you see are games with the same icons? Right now, I can only find new games on Roblox through two ways: Social media and other people's favorites.
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        Because of the problems of game discovery on Roblox, I feel that smaller developers, including me, struggle to get recognized within the platform. We should not have to pay to be on the front page to build our reputation on the platform. The games we make should do that. A low/zero player count does not always show how good your game is nor show how capable or creative you are as a developer/game-designer.
      </p>
      <h2>The Short-Term Solution</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        I made this website to show how tags could solve the problem of not finding new games on the platform. A "tag" would be a word that would describes a game. Including tags to your game could help attract the audience you want without having to spend money on advertiments, trying to compete a spot for the front page. (which is unlikely if you are a small developer) As for the player, it would make it x100 times easier to find or discover a game on the platform. If they give us the ability to add tags to our games, it would clean out all the games that haven't been updated in a while. It would result in a more enjoyable experince when scrolling through the search page. Other game platforms like Steam has this kind of system, so why shouldn't Roblox have a similar implementation? 
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        The reason why I'm calling the RCDP a short-term solution is because I don't want to continue to add games here. That might sound odd, but this website has two goals: 1) Give smaller developers a chance to be recognized as long as the problems of game discovery persist 2) Pressure Roblox to improve their game discovery! If it was easy to find new games to play on Roblox, I would have never had pushed myself to make this site. Imagine going on another website to find games if Roblox already gave us that ability to do it on the platform. 
      </p>
      <h2>The Making of the RCDP</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        There were a few things that stood out to me when I started to work on this project. There were so many types of games, how would I categorize them all into one or two words? Everytime I added a tag that would describe a game on Roblox, I would manage to think of more tags for other games. Initially, I added the genres that Roblox had, along with some common games we see on the platform, like "Obby" or "Simulator". But, there would be more games that did not fit with what I had, so I had to debate whether or not to include that specific tag. It might seem obvious that there are alot of games on Roblox, but it always felt like I've played them all. (that discussion is for another day) Anyway, adding too many tags could be a problem because there would be alot to maintain and moderate. (Moderation, uh oh) Developers could just add random tags to their game and end up putting themselves on the top of the search page. Or some could use irrelevant tags that aren't used as much and they would be able to put themselves on the top more easily. Thinking about all these different possibilities made my head hurt. In the end, I decided to add a few rules and requirements on tags and other things when requsting to add your game to the RCDP, which I will share in a later DevForum post.
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        The night after I created the structure of the website, I lost around 3 hours of sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about one question I had about this whole idea of making this. I asked myself,  
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Who would benefit from this?"
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "People who use this website."
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Who?"
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Users who are bored and want to look for games, and smaller developers who want to get their games out there."
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Ok buut... who's gonna see this website?"
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Oh"
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        Well I know I'd share this to people on the DevForum and on my Twitter, but who was gonna look at it besides them? (Who would even add their game here?) Most kids of Roblox don't have Twitter let alone be a member of the DevForum. But I didn't worry about that too much. If no one added their games or if Roblox added tags right when I shared this website, I wouldn't mind. At least I would have a finished project. This was the real question, however, that stuck to me,
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        "Will this benefit everyone equally?"
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        I don't know why, but it kept me awake. I realized that if developers requested to add multiple games to this website, they would have an advantage over other developers. If some developers added more tags to their games than others, they would get an advantage. I didn't know how big of an impact it would make, but I knew users would see their games more. The RCDP would ultimately become a platform for another platform. Roblox and social media should be your only platorm, not the site itself. That is why I decided that if your want your game to be added, it will be the only game that you put on the RCDP. (and a max of 3 tags)
      </p>
      <p class="desc">
        If you have actually read this far into this essay of how I overthought this whole process of making a website, and wondered why you can only have one game, it's simple. I want every developer on here to have an equal playing field, and get people into the habit of checking out people's profiles more. If you like their game and found it here, favorite or follow their game, go on their profile, find the other games they made, and follow their their social media accounts if they have one. That way you will be updated with their work, and it will help them too in the end.
      </p>
      <h2>Final Thoughts & Hopes</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Honestly, I hope to see more original, quality games on Roblox and maybe even games for older audiences if Roblox. Some games on the platform were clearly just made to make a quick profit off of little kids, and it kind of bums me out because there is so much you can do on Roblox Studio other than creating scam games. At the same time, there are probably so many games out there on Roblox that are made with effort and care that I've never seen yet. It is so hard right now to follow developers and see what they create within the platform and I just wish it changes soon. Roblox, you can't fit every good game on the front page. I shouldn't need to be on the front page to be successful on the platform. Give us the ability to find games outside the front page, so we can give ourseleves more time with one thing. The game, the experience. 
      </p>
      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Two people indirectly inspired me to make the RCDP. One of them was KonekoKitten (a popular Roblox commantator on Youtube), who made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDw-pB2nWkI" target="_blank">a video</a> about the state of the platform. Along with everyone in the comments, it made me realize that I was not the only one that thought Roblox was reaching this point where it just got stale. I knew that part of the reason why everything on Roblox felt stale was because it is hard to find new and original games. The second person was Dani, also a popular game-developer on Youtube, who made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeZHG1bFJDg" target="_blank">a video</a> on how he created a website in two days, which clicked the two ideas together. "Why don't I make a website to solve the issue of game discovery on Roblox?" I took extra-curricular classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript anyway, so why shouldn't I brush up on those skills? Plus, it's a probably much better idea than registering for your classes for college. (ok it's probably not, so I should probably stop typing and sha-)
      </p>
      <h2>Feeling Lucky?</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        You have probably noticed the "Feeling Lucky?" button on the <a href="discover.html">Discover</a> page. If you're wondering how it works, it will give you a random game that is on the RCDP, or it will give you a random game from your results. Pretty neat, so go ahead and try it!
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        As you can see above, I type too much, which is hopefully not concerning. I also make games on Roblox and you can view my profile on the bottom of the page by clicking on my username. (You can also follow me on Twitter!) I hope you found the RCDP to some use to you!
